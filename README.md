# Tomato AI Project 🌿🍅
A suite of four deep‑learning models to help farmers and buyers rapidly detect leaf diseases, track growth stages, and assess tomato freshness.
This repository contains four deep‐learning models:

1. 🍃 **Leaf Disease Detection** – YOLOv8 model to detect common tomato leaf diseases.  
2. 🆕 **Modified Leaf Disease Detection** – Custom‑tuned YOLOv8 for improved accuracy in low‑light scenarios.  
3. 🌱 **Growth Stage Classification** – YOLOv8 to determine tomato plant growth stage.  
4. 🍅 **Freshness Evaluation** – MobileNetV3 classifier to assess tomato ripeness and quality.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `leaf_disease_model/`: YoloV8 to detect leaf diseases.
- `modifed_leaf_disease_model/`: YoloV8 to detect leaf diseases with updates in the dataset + MobileNetV3 classifier.
- `growth_stage_model/`: YoloV8 to determine the stage of tomato plant growth.
- `freshness_model/`: MobileNetV3 classifier for tomato freshness.
