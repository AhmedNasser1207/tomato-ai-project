# Tomato AI Project 🌿🍅

This repository contains four deep learning models for:

1. 🍃 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
2. 🍃 Modifed Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
3. 🌱 Tomato Growth Stage Classification
4. 🍅 Tomato Freshness Evaluation

## 📁 Project Structure

- `leaf_disease_model/`: YoloV8 to detect leaf diseases.
- `growth_stage_model/`: YoloV8 to determine the stage of tomato plant growth.
- `freshness_model/`: MobileNetV3 classifier for tomato freshness.
